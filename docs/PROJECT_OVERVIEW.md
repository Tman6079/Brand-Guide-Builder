A structured document generated by an AI model (Claude API), using predefined prompts.

## Input Modes

### URL Scan (Simple)
- User inputs a URL
- App indexes content from the URL
- Sends extracted content to AI
- AI returns a brand guide

### Battle Mode (Gamified)
- User URL + interactive content battles
- Two pieces of brand-related content "fight"
- Winner advances across 5 rounds
- Each win is tracked
- Final win ratios + URL content are sent to AI
- AI generates brand guide based on:
  - URL data
  - Winning content patterns

### Survey Mode (Detailed)
- 24-question survey
- Answers sent to AI
- AI generates brand guide

## Constraints / Assumptions

- Claude API is available
- Brand guide prompts already exist
- Battle content already exists
- App only needs to:
  - Track wins
  - Pass structured data to AI
- UI fun matters for Battle Mode
- Sound + animations are desirable but modular
